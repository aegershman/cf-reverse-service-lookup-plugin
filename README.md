# cf-reverse-service-lookup-plugin

cf-cli plugin to perform reverse lookups against service instance GUIDs

## background

Pairs nicely with problematic BOSH service instances üëåüë©‚Äçüç≥

This plugin aims to map between how BOSH references service deployments, e.g. `service-instance_GUID`, and how they're referenced in Cloud Foundry. It can be frustrating when tools like the bosh-cli and Prometheus/Alertmanager start yelling about a service instance barfing, but you have to spend time going through this whole riggamarole of looking up the service to see which org/space it belongs to, etc.

With this plugin, as long as you're logged into the same Cloud Foundry installation as the `service-instance_GUID` you're trying to find, this will go through the whole riggamarole of looking up the org/space of the service instance _for_ you.

## usage

```sh
# get details on a service instance by it's GUID alone
cf rsl -s 4c463943-d421-4f6f-8501-247fba95882d

# passing BOSH's default 'service-instance_' prefix is acceptable, too
cf rsl -s service-instance_4c463943-d421-4f6f-8501-247fba95882d

# you can pass '-s service-instance_GUID' multiple times
cf rsl -s service-instance_4c463943-d421-4f6f-8501-247fba95882d -s bbaa77df-52e7-4d6a-8c86-d07a7c93ab82

# optionally, multiple different presentation formats can be specified
cf rsl -s xyz --format json (default)
cf rsl -s xyz --format table

# or both, why not
cf rsl -s xyz --format table --format json
```

`--format json`:

```json
{
  "organization": {
    "name": "gershman"
  },
  "service": {
    "name": "tiny-turtle-sql",
    "space_guid": "4ba83909-cde1-448e-873f-d53b27391604"
  },
  "space": {
    "name": "dev",
    "organization_guid": "a297887a-f58f-4266-9ba2-186563eec13a"
  }
}
```

`--format table`:

```txt
+----------+-------+-----------------+
|   ORG    | SPACE |     SERVICE     |
+----------+-------+-----------------+
| gershman | dev   | tiny-turtle-sql |
+----------+-------+-----------------+
```
